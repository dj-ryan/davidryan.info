This is the repo hosting my personal website. It is hosted on Netlify and built with Gatsby.

## Theme

I used a [Minimal Portfolio Theme](https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/gatsby-theme-portfolio-minimal) for this website. I made some changes to the theme to fit my needs. But it was a fantastic starting point and is loaded with tones of features, I highly recommend it.
